## Know our project

The restaurant service improvement system, named Spiser, is a project developed to obtain the diploma of the technical course of ETEC Raposo Tavares.<br/>
Spiser is the first application developed for this project. <br/>
Its objective is to give total freedom to the customer of the establishment to place their orders individually. Using the application on his smartphone, the customer will be able to: 
<br/>- Perform your registration or login if you have already registered;
<br/>- Access the menu and see all the products that the establishment offers;
<br/>- View information about the product (Name, price, size, among others);
<br/>- Add the desired order to the cart, apply the discount coupon and the table where the customer is;
<br/>- Be aware of the final price of your order;
<br/>- Track the status of your order.
<br/> All of these functions can be performed by the establishment's customers directly from their smartphones, in a clean, fluid and easy-to-use interface.
